# ITF patterns App

This android app provides a handy reference to all the patterns in ITF Taekwondo. 
Useful for those wanting to have a nice mobile companion to review techniques for a particular pattern. 

The main list view of the app uses [Litho](https://fblitho.com/), a declaritive UI framework for android built by Facebook. 
I think the framework is interesting and makes development simpler (from a programing model point of view), but I think the framework 
has a ways to go. 

Users can also create and edit notes to help them when learning specific tecniques or patterns.
